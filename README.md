# Organization 1

## Overview and learning objectives

Students will learn the benefits of project and folder organization,
and how these enable reproducibility and reusability. They will then
complete an activity highlighting the structure of data files,
emphasizing the importance of documenting any changes made. 

At the begining of the session, students should be able

- to use a spreadsheet program to generate a plot
- to use a text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) to communicate

At the end of the session students will be able to

- Evaluate folder and file structure of a project.
- Recognize common problems that occur in file organization.
- Be able to identify what plain text is.
- Demonstrate the benefits of using plain text.
- Distinguish between input and output files.
- Integrate file naming standards to projects.

## File organization

### Activity - Forensic Science

Lesson: [01-file-organization](01-file-organization.md)

This section starts with an activity to get the students thinking
about "excavating" a folder in the future.  It is meant to get the
students thinking about what file names, file organization, and file
content and what these can tell us about a project.

### Lecture - File Naming 

Slides can be found here, in Keynote format, in PDF, and as individual
PNGs (scroll down through the README):
